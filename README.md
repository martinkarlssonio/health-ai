<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<br>
Intention with this project is to provide a boilerplate for creating a project with Data Science notebooks for development of models that can predict and forecast various health related use-cases. The project is based on a Jupyter Notebook environment and is intended to be run on AWS SageMaker.
The models will be accessed by a Generative AI model hosted in AWS Bedrock, invoked by a Lambda and triggered by API Gateway.

#### Data Science
Jupyter notebook examples to be used for development of models. The notebooks are based on Python and uses libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and Seaborn. They explore some health related datasets and provide examples of how to preprocess, train and evaluate models along with data exploration and visualization.
